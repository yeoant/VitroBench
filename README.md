This repository keeps the software that is used in this project:

## Workstation Software
â€‹Note: Sniffing software is from [TSMaster](https://github.com/TOSUN-Shanghai/TSMaster).

| Python Program | Description |
|:---------------|:------------|
| bmw_bridge_passthru.py | This program performs a pass-through of all messages via the bridge. |
| bmw_cas130_attack.py | This attack forces the car to stop. CAS is isolated and bridged from KCAN. Within the  program, setting (attack_type=1) stops the car when the driver starts the car for the third time and setting (attack_type=2) stops the car when the  car is running, and a specified time duration is reached. |
| bmw_ekp_attackBridge.py | This is an  attack on the fuel pump controller by bridging Engine ECU from PCAN. Byte  7 (D8) of message 0xAA was fuzzed when the Engine RPM is greater than  750. During the attack, EKP outputs an erratic fuel pump signal. |
| bmw_ekp_attackInject_Burst.py | This is  an attack on the fuel pump controller by injecting messages 0xAA to PCAN.  Byte 7 (D8) of message 0xAA was fuzzed when the Engine RPM is greater than 850. During the attack, EKP outputs an erratic fuel pump signal. |
| bmw_flooding_inject_deltatime_stealth.py | This is a flooding attack by injecting stealth messages from 0x0 to 0x1A5 to KCAN to cause a denial of service to the instrument cluster. The attack stopped the display message 0x1A6 to reach the Instrument Cluster. |
| bmw_floodin8g_inject_deltatime.py | This  is a flooding attack by injecting message 0x80 to KCAN to cause a denial of service to the instrument cluster. The attack stopped the display message 0x1A6 to reach the Instrument Cluster. |
| bmw_jbe_fuzz1_v10.py | This program  conducts a penetration test by injecting random message IDs and data from the external Diagnostic network. The workstation can monitor all the In-Vehicle Networks (IVNs) messages to check which messages have      infiltrated the IVNs. Within the program, setting (sniff=True) will log the infiltrated messages to the file,      {'jbe_infiltrate'+date_time+'.blf'}. |
| bmw_speed_attack1.py | This attack causes the instrument cluster to display the wrong speed. DSC is isolated and bridged from PCAN. The car runs normally until the attack speed of 40km/h. Thereafter, the speed in message 0x1A6 is randomly set. |
| bmw_speed_attack2.py | This causes the instrument cluster to display the wrong speed. DSC is isolated and bridged from PCAN. The car runs normally until the attack speed of 10 km/h. Thereafter, the speed message 0x1A6 is incremented by 2/3 of the actual increased speed and clipped at the maximum speed of 35 km/h. |
